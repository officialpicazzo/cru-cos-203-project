<h1>My Favorite Gist: "Believe You Can and You're Halfway There"</h1>
<p>As the great Theodore Roosevelt once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Believe you can and you're halfway there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote has always resonated with me, and I try to live by its wisdom every day. It's a reminder that having confidence and faith in ourselves is crucial to achieving our goals.</p>
<p>In fact, research has shown that having a positive mindset can increase our chances of success by up to 50%! (Abbreviation: <abbr title="Research Shows Believing Takes">RSBT</abbr>)</p>
<p>So, the next time you're facing a challenge, remember that believing in yourself is half the battle. Take a deep breath, stay positive, and go for it!</p>
